# The Austindex

A Lightweight Guide to Austin, Texas

## Purpose

Imagine you're the kind of person who gets travel advice from a Readme.  This guide is designed to turn you into such a person.  It consists of a set of activities, indexed by type, along with a _heavily subjective_ evaluation of each.  We start with food, move on to activities, and finish with a miscellany bucket.  If you try anything and it doesn't fit my description, please let me know right away.  Have fun!

*Disclaimer #1: Some of this information may be out of date, and should be verified with a trusted source like Yelp or Google Maps.  When in doubt, don't take my word for it - check it out yourself, and feel free to let me know what's changed.*

*Disclaimer #2: These evaluations are entirely subjective and represent my opinions alone, rather than an endorsement from any organization or from my place of work.  If your favorite place of business doesn't appear, there's a good chance I just haven't been there yet.*

## Activities

### Breakfast

In no particular order:

**Juiceland** Phenomenal smoothies and juices.  Personal recommendation for sweet-tooths (sweet-teeth?) is the Originator.  I still go here a lot, it's still excellent.

**Rudy's** Barbecue place by afternoon, breakfast taco joint by morning.  Very meat-oriented, and I recommend the Chop Taco.

**Phoebe's Diner** Small diner known for its Barbecue Burger and its Shrimp and Grits

**The Well** Creative health food, but hear me out.  Their salmon avocado toast and chia seed pudding are both wonderful, and you'll leave pretty happy.

**24 Diner** Pretty standard southern breakfast food such as Chicken and Waffles.  Probably most filling breakfast in the Seaholm area.

**Torchy's** Breakfast tacos are pretty great.  The Ace of Spades from the secret menu is the best.

### Lunch

Ordered from cheap and tasty to expensive and experiential.

**Super Burrito** Food truck specializing in - uh - burritos.  Not particularly authentic, but the steak and chorizo options are delicious.

**Taquerias Arandinas** Authentic Mexican food.  The sincronizada is easily the best take on a quesadilla I know.

**Austin's Habibi** Middle Eastern food truck, with rice, salad, and gyro options.  Parked right next to Super Burrito if you change your mind.

**P. Terry's** A very local burger chain with a limited menu of burgers and shakes.  Everything it does, it does well.

**Snarf's Sandwiches** Full disclaimer: I've only ever ordered this for delivery, but their veggie sandwich is to die for.

**Teji's** Indian food for college students.  Not fancy, but really flavorful.

**Torchy's** Our friend from the breakfast menu returns with lots of eclectic lunch options.

**Chi'Lantro** Korean fusion chain - one of my go-to's before Covid, though haven't been there in awhile.

**Walton's Fancy and Staple** A deli on 6th with awesome sandwiches.  Excellent Reuben.  Also good for breakfast.

**Loro** Japanese Steakhose, a cooperative venture between the owners of Franklin's and Uchi.  Best items include Chicken Karaage and Brisket Burger.

**Perry's Steakhose** Upscale steakhouse.  Lunch specials make it affordable, while for dinner, it's a great splurge option.  Ironically, the porkchop is the best item on the menu.

**Franklin's BBQ** Best barbecue in Austin.  Wait time is often over three hours and no reservations are accepted.  However, if you can get a few friends together, you can preorder takeout.

### Dinner

Sit-down restaurant focused. A few options from the lunch menu could also go here (Perry's, Loro, Torchy's, etc).

**Via 313** Detroit-style pizza that will leave you fat and happy.

**Kura** Sushi delivered on a conveyor belt, reasonably priced.  A little far north, but the drive mitigates the food coma.

**Madam Mam's** Local Thai chain.  Curries and Fried Rice are out of this world, though their Pad Thai is basically ketchup noodles. Note also there is a Baskin Robbins two doors down.

**Clay Pit** Nice Indian restaurant.  Remember to order food Desi Hot if you want any heat.

**Gangnam** All-you-can-eat Korean Barbecue.

**Salt Lick** All-you-can-eat Texas Barbecue.

**Sushi Junai** All-you-can-eat Sushi.  Their north location, Sushi Junai 2, has more seating.

**Numero 28** Fairly authentic Italian trattoria on 2nd.  Staff are very accommodating, and pasta is delicious.

**Devil May Care** Hidden Mediterranean-style tapas restaurant.  Expensive but unbelievably flavorful.  Best menu items include the lobster tail on lettuce and the ricotta with pita.  

**La Condesa** Creative Spanish food.  Great ceviche.

**El Naranjo** Upscale Oaxacan food, won a James Beard awared a couple years back.  Both the queso fundido and mole options deserve special mention.

**J. Carver's Steakhouse** Hidden steakhouse on West 6th.  The steak is overhyped, but the apps and drinks are phenomenal.

**Uchi** Probably the best restaurant in Austin.  Sushi and sushi-inspired.  They also know their sake.  Save up for this one, it's 100% worth it.  (Their sister restaurant, Uchiko, is also excellent.)

### Tea and Coffee

Probably the best thing about Austin, if you know where to go.

**Bennu** Selection of unique and flavorful mochas and baked goods.  Open 24/7, great for studying at odd hours.

**Codependent** Chic coffee shop in the heart of Seaholm which converts to a bar after 6PM.  Drinks are fine, vibe is wonderful.

**The Hideout** Hidden coffee shop on Congress with solid selection.  Near a Tacodeli, so food is covered.  Good for quiet work in the early morning.

**Barley Bean** Little place on South Lamar.  Very large drink selection and tasty baked goods.

**Manana** Best mocha in town.

**Opa** Greek food and good coffee.  Great for snacking while reading.

**Nate's Baked Goods and Coffee** Bakery and coffee shop east of Lamar which also carries breakfast options.  Definitely try the Charlie Sheen and the cinnamon roll

**1886 Cafe** Attached to the beautiful Driskill Hotel, the mocha and croissants are great and the vibes are immaculate.

**Zhi Tea** East side tea shop with a massive selection of loose-leaf teas, both true and herbal.  The owner is extremely friendly and the sample flights make bulk buying easy.

**West China Tea** Eclectic tea shop specializing in unique varietals imported directly from China.  Owner is extremely knowledgeable about tea craft and culture.

**Stouthaus** Espresso bar and bar-bar.  A good place to hang out if you're stuck in the south during traffic.

### Treats

Skewed toward ice cream, but is that so bad?

**Jeni's Ice Cream** National chain, but extremely tasty.  A reduced pint selection can also be found at Whole Foods.

**Amy's Ice Cream** Local chain, focused on unique flavors and topping selection.  True Ice Cream rather than soft serve.

**Baked Bear** Imagine an ice cream sandwich, but the bread is two cookies and the ice cream is extra ice cream.

### Night Life

Austin's night life is a complex and ever-evolving system.  Here's the basic layout:
* East 6th: Casual bars and brewery space, focused on eclectic cocktails and beers
* Dirty 6th: Where to go when you want to get trashed.  Concentrated collegiate atmosphere.
* West 6th: Dance and whiskey bars.  Used to be pretty nice, but becoming more like Dirty.
* Rainey: Similar to West 6th, nice area to go out with friends.  Lines here can get pretty long.
* The Domain: Far north of the others, it's got its own ecosystem of bars and restaurants.  Good for a visit, but have a designated driver.

A few bars stand out.  Ranked from naughty to nice:

**Frazier's Long and Low** An old-Austin establishment, probably the best place to get cheap beer and goof off.

**Icenhauer's** Where every night on Rainey inevitably ends.  Tasty cocktails and outdoor space, but gets pretty crowded.

**Pinthouse Pizza** Good beer selection and great pizza, good for a happy hour get-together.

**Mort Subite** Belgian beer bar on Congress.  If you like strong European beers, give this a try.

**Easy Tiger** Big soft pretzels and several types of mustard - the drinks are almost secondary.

**Midnight Cowboy** Another speakeasy, but pretty well known and requires reservations.  Small outdoor section is pleasant on warm evenings.

**Tipsy Alchemist** Rainey mainstay with creative drinks.  Can get VERY loud.

**Codependent** Chill vibes, nice outdoor space.  A little pricey.  Also a coffee shop (see above).

**San Gines** Barcelona-themed drinks, but be warned: the 'sipping chocolate' is just a cup of the churro dip from the food truck next door.  I'd order it again.

**Swift's Attic** Another nice sit-down with a phenomenal liquor selection.  Frequented by some of the city's high-flyers.

**Small Victory** Objectively the best cocktails in Austin.  Sitdown speakeasy hidden above a parking garage, so good for chatting.

**Seven Grand** If you like whiskey or scotch, this is the best place to get it.

For dancing, pretty much anything on West 6th or Rainey will do the trick.  For dirty dancing, see the movie, or go to Dirty 6th.

### Outdoors

Another Austin forte, though keep the temperature curve in mind while doing your planning.

**Zilker Park** Immense open space, large enough for frisbee or football.  It contains volleyball courts, offers lake trail access, and is pet-friendly.

**Barton Springs** Huge open-air swimming pool fed from a cold spring.  Free before 8AM, with a more natural downstream area free and open 24/7.  Great for early morning swims.

**Zilker Botanical** Outdoor complex complete with succulent garden, bamboo forest, Japanese Garden, herbs (which you can eat if nobody's looking), and butterfly trail.  Reservations required.

**The Greenbelt** A sprawling trail complex south of the city.  Multiple trailheads permit extremely long hikes, and the creek is nice for swimming when the water is up.

**McKinney State Park** Large hiking park.  There are old plantation ruins up in the woods if you can find them.

**Emma Long Park** Good barbecue and swimming spot north of the river.  Reservations recommended.

**Butler Trail** 10 miles of hike/bike trail surrounding Lady Bird Lake.  Fairly well lit - great for running at all hours.

**Kayaking/Paddleboarding** Numerous centers for kayaking and paddleboarding on Lady Bird Lake.  Prices vary, so I won't recommend a favorite.

**Farmer's Market** Saturdays 9AM to 1PM, Republic Square.  Fresh ingredients, food, and art.  Highly recommend the mycology stand if you like mushrooms.

**Enchanted Rock** Huge dome about two hours out of town.  Get there a couple hours before sunset to avoid heat, as the climb isn't very long.  Very dark skies permit awesome stargazing as well.

**Fredericksburg** Cute old German settlement near Enchanted Rock.  Lots of shopping, including a mind-altering hot-sauce store and great german food.

**Port Aransas** About four hours away, good for a day or weekend trip.  Beautiful, clean sand beaches, best I've found in Texas.

### Museums

**Bullock Texas History Museum** Artifacts from the history of Texas, including most of a colonial-era ship raised from the gulf, and a moon rock.

**Texas Science and Natural History Museum** Incredible fossil collection, on the UT campus.

**Blanton Museum of Art** Modern art museum on the UT campus.  Often hosts really interesting travelling exhibits.

**Texas State Capitol** Exactly what it sounds like.  Beautiful interior spaces and artwork, though it helps to know some Texas history before visiting.

**San Antonio Museum of Art** Art museum a good hour outside of town.  Emphasis on modern and realist art, though all eras and most regions are represented.

**The Alamo** Memorable.

### Other

**Book People** A local bookstore with titles focused on current thought.

**Half Price Books** A chain of used bookstores where one can find some gems - found an 1850's copy of Gibbon and a full set of the Feynman lectures, as well as numerous engineering books.

**MT Supermarket** Asian-themed supermarket serving all your asian cooking needs.

**Asahi Imports** Japanese import store with all main ingredients for Japanese cooking, as well as a nice upscale sake selection.  The staff are very knowledgeable as well.

**Cafe Monet** Pottery studio where you can either throw your own pottery, or paint pre-thrown pottery.  Good way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

**Buccee's** Experience it at least once.

**Total Wine** A Wal-Mart-sized wine shop.

**Austin Public Library** The downtown branch is really quite something, worth visiting if you're downtown.

**Comedy Shows** Austin has a thriving comedy scene.  Visit Do512.com to find shows.

**The Domain** Essentially a huge outdoor mall acting as a secondary downtown, complete with shopping, restaurants, theaters, and bars.

**Houston** About three hours away, good for a day trip.  Way better Asian food than anywhere in Austin, and home to a great NASA museum.

## Future Plans

This list is still expanding.  I don't have much experience with breweries or sporting venues, so anyone who does, please feel free to hit me up.  Thanks!

## License

Why are you even here, demanding license info for experiences?  Go home.  Find something else to do.

If you insist, it's available under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/)

**Enjoy!**
